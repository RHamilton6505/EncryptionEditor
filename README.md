# EncryptionEditor

Non school related project. This program is an extremely lightweight text editor that encrypts using a Vigenere and AES

To execute, run GUI.java. Enter the password in the bottom frame, and then assign the password in the file menu. The program will open and save from a file called "Memos" in a home directory (will need to be added by yourself). The password will need to be added before opening or saving.
